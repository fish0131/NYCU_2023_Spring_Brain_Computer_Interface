2. *Alpha wave*: action trigger  
```Python
peak_alpha = the sum of frequency in alpha wave(8-13Hz)/the sum of the frequency in 3-30Hz  
if (peak_alpha > threshold): 
  action point to 1  
else: 
  action point to 0  
```
- (0, 1) will have four combinations (forward, right, left, stop)
- To implement this project: `python ./src/utils.py`
